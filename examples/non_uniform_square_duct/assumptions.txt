It is assumed that y and z are the directions that boast the non-uniform mesh.
The z direction is made using the grid stretching function and the y direction is made using user input from the file mesh.csv.
Cell wall position is given in this mesh.csv for the moment.
At the moment the user input is giving clustering in the middle.
Cell wall positions range from 0 to 1 (normalized position of the mesh). In the future an option to provide both the absolute position and normalized position can be added.
